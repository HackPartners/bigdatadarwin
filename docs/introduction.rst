Introduction
============

This library wraps the complexity of accessing the National Rail Darwin Push Port, hiding all the
details of how it works and providing you with a simple stream of pyton objects representing the
messages provided by the Push Port, and allowing you to process or store them as you see fit.

Please look at the included example.py file for how to quickly get started, and for the details of
the individual message types, you should read the reference section of this documentation.
